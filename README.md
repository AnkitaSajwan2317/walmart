In today’s hyper-competitive e-commerce environment, retaining customers has become an uphill battle. With the average retention rate hovering at just 23%, a staggering 77% of customers are churning, leading to significant revenue loss. In a market like India, where acquiring a single customer can cost between INR 800 to INR 1500, the stakes are even higher. Walmart must not only attract customers but also keep them engaged and satisfied to ensure a positive return on investment.

Yet, the challenges don’t stop there. Modern shoppers come to Walmart with high expectations—they want specific products, available when they need them. But when those items are out of stock, frustration sets in. Customers don’t just leave empty-handed; they turn to competitors or offline retailers, causing Walmart to lose valuable foot traffic and sales opportunities. Even when products are in stock, the experience can be cumbersome. Shoppers often find themselves endlessly scrolling and searching through lists, trying to locate the items they need, which detracts from the seamless, efficient shopping experience they crave.

This project is designed to tackle these pain points head-on. By integrating advanced predictive models into Walmart’s e-commerce platform, we aim to revolutionize how the company approaches customer engagement. Through precise churn prediction, optimized customer acquisition, insightful RFM analysis, and personalized product recommendations, Walmart will not only reduce churn and lower acquisition costs but also streamline the shopping experience. Smarter inventory management will ensure that key products are always in stock, while intuitive search functionalities will help customers find what they need quickly and easily, minimizing frustration and keeping them on the platform.

The result? A highly personalized, efficient, and engaging shopping experience that fosters long-term loyalty, drives sustainable growth, and ensures Walmart remains a leader in the competitive e-commerce market.
